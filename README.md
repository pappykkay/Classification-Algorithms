# Classification-Algorithms
The study aims to apply classification algorithms to the accident severity dataset and compare their performance using applicable metrics. It contains the implementation of k-Nearest Neighbour and logistic regression algorithms for classification on selected dataset. The dataset for the classification algorithms task is a truncated and abridged version of the UK Road Safety Statistics. Full Data download can be obtained from (https://roadtraffic.dft.gov.uk/custom-downloads/road-accidents).

Logistic regression recorded an accuracy score of 61% after hyperparameter tuning while k nearest neighbor achieved 67%. While the results is not a direct pointer to the supremacy of KNearest neighbour over logistic regression, we noticed the structure of the dataset played a more vital role over hyperparametre tuning. The dataset was subjected to multiclass neural network using Azure Data Studio in a separate experiment and yielded an accuracy score of 69%.
