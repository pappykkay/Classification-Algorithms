# Classification-Algorithms
The study aims to apply classification algorithms to the accident severity dataset and compare their performance using applicable metrics. It contains the implementation of k-Nearest Neighbour and logistic regression algorithms for classification on selected dataset. The dataset for the classification algorithms task is a truncated and abridged version of the UK Road Safety Statistics.
